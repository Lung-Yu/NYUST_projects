2. 期中報告Bayesian Classification
In this project, you are required to do the following.<br/>
(1)  Simulate two coins with the bias specified by 0.56 and 0.38 with.<br/>
(2)  Use the simulated coin with bias 0.56 to randomly generate 6000 samples with.<br/>
(3)  Use the simulated coin with bias 0.38 to randomly generate 4000 samples with.<br/>
(4) Mixed the two data sets obtained by parts (2) and (3) to form a test set, which consists of 10,000 samples with dimensionality  , each of which has components   either 0 (representing a tail) or 1 (representing a head).<br/>
(5)  Classify all the samples in  using the criterion given by Eq. (2).<br/>
(6)  Calculate the classification rate .<br/>
(7) Repeat parts (1-6) by extending two coins to three coins with bias specified by 1/3, 1/2, 3/4 where the mixed data set is made up of 10,000 generated by the coin with bias 1/2, 6,000 by the coin with bias 1/3 and 4,000 by the coin with bias 3/4.<br/>

Your project report should clearly describe how you simulate coins with different biases and how you construct the data sets, More importantly, you should tabulate your classification results of 10000 data samples and the classification rates.<br/>
